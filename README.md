Jupyter Notebook for FreeCodeCamp Bonfire notes and solutions.

[Basic Algorithm Scripting](https://github.com/dting/fccbonfires/tree/master/basic)

The readability of the solutions is emphasized for the Basic Algorithm Scripting solutions, hopefully making them easier to understand at the cost of conciseness.

The Basic Algorithm Scripting solutions using loops avoid using instance functions as much as possible. This is to highlight the logic and control flow of the solutions.
